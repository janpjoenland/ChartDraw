# ChartDraw

A graphical Python application for drawing astrological charts.

## Requirements

-  Python >= 3.4
-  Tkinter

For Windows, installing Python through [Anaconda](http://anaconda.com) is
recommended. The Tkinter library should be included with all Windows
installations.
On Linux, you may have to install the Tkinter library separately, for instance
through your package manager.

## Running the application

From the project root folder, run `python3 app.py <path-to-chart-data>`.
The chart data may be a ZET 9 text file (Table.txt), or
a configuration previously exported from ChartDraw.
